# Arguments
- `secondorder_cutoff::T`: Cutoff for the second order force constants.
- `thirdorder_cutoff::T = -1.0`: Cutoff for the third order force constants.
- `fourthorder_cutoff::T = -1.0`: Cutoff for the fourth order force constants.
- `polar::Bool = false`: Add dipoleâ€“dipole corrections for polar materials.
- `stride::Int = 1`: Use every N-th configuration instead of all (useful for long MD runs with linearly dependent frames).
- `firstorder::Bool = false`: Include the first order force constants (for finite-temperature equilibrium structure).
- `temperature::T = -1.0`: Temperature for the self-consistent solver.
- `norotational::Bool = false`: Turn off imposing rotational invariance (needed for 2D systems).
- `nohuang::Bool = false`: Turn off imposing Huang invariances (useful for 2D systems).
- `nohermitian::Bool = false`: Turn off imposing Hermitian invariance.

# Description
The main algorithm of the TDEP method. Starting from a symmetry analysis, this 
command finds the irreducible representation of the interatomic force constants and 
extracts them from position and force data.
